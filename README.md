<h2 align="center">Awesome lists of free hosters for your projects</h2>

Name & Url | Languages | Can project be private | Is plans cheap | Description | My opinion description
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
[Qovery](https://qovery.com/) | NodeJS, Python, Typescript, Go, PHP, Java & Ruby | Yes | Yes | _Qovery_ helps tech companies to deploy their apps on AWS in just a few seconds. _Qovery_ is the simplest way to deploy your full-stack apps. | Qovery is one of the best NodeJS hoster you can find, It's also free forever & you can deploy as much as you want. But on the Qovery v2 there is a lot of changes now Qovery will give you a free $45 Qovery credits and once your credit is 0 in within 48 hours your applications will be shutdown. For more information visit [me](https://www.qovery.com/blog/how-qovery-community-plan-works).
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) | NodeJS, Go, Python & Ruby | Yes | Yes | Vercel is **a platform for static sites and frontend frameworks**, built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database. We provide a frictionless developer experience to take care of the hard things: deploy instantly, scale automatically, and serve personalized content around the globe. | I have tried Vercel and It's really good It also gives you **up to 100GB Bandwidth** and more. The only biggest con for Vercel is its serverless. But overall It's really good for frontend & backend developers.
[Glitch](https://glitch.com/) |Java, C#, Python, Go, Rust, Racket, Nodejs, Typescript, Elm, Fable, Bucklescript & Purescript | Yes(But it's not free) | Yes | Create your next web project in your browser with no setup and we'll instantly deploy it. | I used this to host my Discord bots before Heroku and that was the time where making your projects private is free and It's really good. But now you can't make your projects private for free It's paid.
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) | NodeJS, Ruby, PHP, Java, Python, Go, Scala & Clojure | Yes | Yes | _Heroku_ is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. | 2 last years I used Heroku to host my Discord bots and the only thing that is bad is It gives you 550 Dyno and once that Dyno is gone your applications will automatically died and to get another Dyno you need to wait for 1 month. But It's really good I recommend Heroku too.
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) | Java, Go, PowerShell, Nodejs, C#, Python & Ruby | Yes | I don't know | Whether you're looking for compute power, database storage, content delivery, or other functionality, AWS has the services to help you build sophisticated applications with increased flexibility, scalability and reliability. | No opinion, I haven't used it.
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) | Python, Ruby, Go, NodeJS, Pearl, Typescript, PHP, Rust & more | Yes | Yes | Build apps faster, make smarter business decisions, and connect people anywhere. | No opinion, I haven’t used it.
[Discloud](https://discloudbot.com/) | NodeJS | Yes | Yes | DisCloud was born with the desire to offer easy, free and quality hosting for Discord Bots. | No pinion, I haven't used it.
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) | Python, Ruby, Go, NodeJS, Pearl, Typescript, PHP, Rust & more | Yes | Yes | Always know what you'll pay with monthly caps and flat pricing across all data centers. | No opinion, I haven’t used it.
[SoloNodes](https://solonodes.xyz/) | NodeJS | Yes | Yes | Freemium Hosting Made Simpler. | I use this to host my bot because It's kinda better than Heroku but you can only make 1 application and It runs forever, If you want to make more applications then earn a AFK points to buy some stuff in the shop using AFK points.
